# Pirate-Stick
Bootable USB version of Pirate Box based on MX-Linux

I intend to provide ISO images you can create your own Pirate Stick from. This repo is not intended to provide every single element or step by step tutorial to create those ISOs, but does serve as a repository for the majority of the elements that I use to create the Pirate Stick ISO.
