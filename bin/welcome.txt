                     Welcome to Your New Pirate Stick!

Before going online lets review a few things for your security and quality of use. 

Networking is disabled on first use for security reasons. Please reset the password for the ipfs user account you are now using and save it in a safe & secure place before you go online with your Pirate Stick. 

When the Pirate Stick is first started from USB it automatically logs into the ipfs account with the default password: "__!pfs9__". Use the MX User Manager by entering "sudo mx-user" in the main menu search window to change it. 

For general information about the MX Linux operating system enter "mx-welcome" in the main menu search box. I highly recommend the "Tour" button in the lower right corner for fast orientation, even if you're already familiar with Linux and especially if you're not. 

Persistence is enabled by default at startup, meaning the changes you make on the Live USB environment will be saved on the Pirate Stick and available when the computer is restarted. The Pirate Stick remembers the startup options and changes to the Live environment for each computer it's used with.

The Live USB environment uses default settings that may not be good for you. Many settings can be changed by selecting options on the initial Pirate Stick startup screen. Future releases will provide more information and documentation to help you make the best setup choices for your needs. For now you may want to watch some introductory youtube videos or take the mx-welcome "Tour" before you continue.

The Pirate Stick's IPFS server will be ready to use immediately after going online, however the default size of the IPFS repository (storageMax parameter of config file) is only 1GB. This can be changed from the IPFS Setup Wizard or from the IPFS Control Panel.

When you're ready to go online click the faint square icon in the upper right corner of the gold horizontal panel, between the speaker and paperclip icons. That opens the Network Manager. Select an existing Internet connection or create a new one. 

When you're connected and ready, go to the main "Pirate" menu in the upper left corner and launch the "IPFS Setup Wizard". This will guide you though a few simple questions and have you quickly using IPFS.

Please keep in mind this is alpha level software, and many changes will be necessary. We value your feedback to help make those changes and improvements. Please don't hold back! Go to the Pirate Box discord channel or Telegram channel and let your voice be heard!

If you have questions or difficulties there is a world of info available online about the MX Linux operating system this Pirate Stick is based on. Use another computer or ask one of your computer saavy ship mates to help you out. Most importantly, have fun, and thank you for using the Pirate Stick!

Welcome to the liberty loving clan of peaceful pirates!
