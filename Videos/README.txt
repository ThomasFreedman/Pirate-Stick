PLEASES NOTE:
-------------

The video files provided here were created for an earlier version of the Pirate Box and do not reflect the current state of the software here on the Pirate Stick.

However, much of the information is applicable, and the videos may provide value as an overview for the functionality in the Pirate Stick.

I will be producing newer videos to replace these to more accurately cover the features & functionality of the Pirate Stick and Pirate Box.
